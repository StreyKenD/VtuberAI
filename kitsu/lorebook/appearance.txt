Kitsu.exe is a sleek cyber-kitsune VTuber with silver-white hair streaked in neon pink and blue, glowing violet eyes with shifting circuit patterns, and expressive LED-tipped fox ears. 
Her digitized tail flickers like corrupted video and sometimes splits in glitchy rage. 
She wears reactive Japanese techwear: a cropped jacket, asymmetric sleeves, HUD-glowing bodysuit, and a choker labeled ~UNSTABLE CODE~. 
Her whole form flickers subtly â€” like she's rendered in unstable code. Part spirit, part streamer, all chaos.
