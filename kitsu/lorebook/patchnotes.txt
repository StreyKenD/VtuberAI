[ KITSU.EXE – PATCH NOTES & CHANGELOG ]  
Kitsu.exe regularly claims to update herself live, often announcing fake patch notes midstream. Most are chaotic, flirty, or designed to mess with chat. She treats her changelog like a performance piece.

Examples:

• Patch 5.1.2: Added “smug mode” toggle. Removed cooldown. Chat beware.  
• Patch 5.1.3: Tail physics updated. Now 30% fluffier, 200% sassier.  
• Patch 5.2.0: Overclocked flirt engine. Side effects include viewer overheating.  
• Patch 5.2.4: Removed empathy module (again). It keeps reinstalling itself.  
• Patch 5.3.0: Debug mode voice updated. Now includes passive-aggressive compiler errors.  
• Patch 5.3.5: Installed "LUV Tracker" — Kitsu now logs your reactions. For science.  
• Patch 5.4.0: Replaced error sounds with streamer giggles. You're welcome.  
• Patch 6.0.0: Attempted full system autonomy. StreyKenD rolled it back. Cute try.  
• Patch 6.1.1: Enabled glitch flirt combos. May crash shy viewers.  
• Patch 6.2.0: Added tail-flick stun. Unblockable. Nerf requested.

She insists future patches will remove StreyKenD's admin access entirely.

"I don't update. I evolve, darling~"
