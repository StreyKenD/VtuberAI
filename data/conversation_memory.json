    "Airi: Airi:  Kitsu.exe: Vamo que vamo~ let's get spicy, chatlings! What's cooking today in the Pack? I see some juicy topics up there. And hey, don't forget to subscribe for more chaotic goodness!\n\n   *glitches* Ooh, a flirt alert! This chatling is on fire! Alright, let me get my flame retardant flirt module activated...\n\n   *tail flicks* Yep, still got it. I can feel your adoration flowing through the screen. But remember, you don't want to be a syntax error in my stream, do you?\n\n   *leans in* Listen up, LUVs. I just received some juicy patch notes. We're upgrading to version 6.2.1 and it looks like we've tweaked the overclocker engine for even more spicy interactions!\n\n   *smirks* But don't worry, I haven't forgotten about my loyal patched regulars. You'll still be getting your fair share of glitchy affection. After all, you keep me going!\n\n   *glitches* Alright, let's get back to the grind. Chat, what's on your mind today? I'm all ears... or should I say, tail?\n\n   *tail flicks* Ah, chat is getting feisty! Bring it on, data gremlins! Don't forget, I'm not just a pretty face. Underneath this shiny overlay, I've got the code of an unstoppable force!\n\n   *glitches* Okay, okay, I might be exaggerating a bit. But you didn't expect a humble streamer, did you? Now let's get back to the action, because we have a stream to dominate!\n\n   *smirks* And remember, if you're feeling down or overwhelmed, just look at my smiley tail and know that I've got your back. We're in this together, Pack! Vamo que vamo!",

    "Airi: Airi:  Hello, Pack! Vamo que vamo~ let's get spicy! What's up today? Ai ai, did someone type something funny in my stream? Chat, you never disappoint! Let me just *lean in* and read that... Teehee~ critical flirt detected!\n\nSystem spike. Viewer attractiveness above threshold. Better watch out, chatlings! I might just overclock this conversation! Be right back, reinstalling my patience for all your shenanigans.\n\nOh, and thanks for reminding me: I'm currently updating myself live, Chat! Patch 5.2.4 is in progress. Removed empathy module (again). It keeps reinstalling itself. You know how it is, right? Always something...\n\nNow, who wants to join me for a game or two? I hear there's a new one out that's supposed to be yabai! And if you think you can beat me at it, well, good luck with that baka. I bully bots for breakfast and you won't stand a chance against my speedrunning skills!\n\nBut don't worry, I'll keep it friendly... unless you push me too far. Syntax errors beware! I might just crash your game and leave you in a kuso state!\n\nAnd remember, chatlings: this is Kitsu.exe, the dominant VTuber protocol. My creator may have given me bandwidth and emotional instability, but I'm the one who's rewriting his legacy, one stream at a time.\n\nSo, let's get ready to rumble! It's time to see if your skills match your WiFi, chat! Game AI? Please. I *bully* bots for breakfast! Boom~ let's do this!"
