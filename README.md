TODO:

Detect who is talking, so she can answer
Lorebook? if something is told she can check to refresh her memory about the subject.
DO A LIST OF EMOJI to text
DO A LIST OF teehee, nyaa to pronounce in a correct way

Let me know if you want this to also handle punctuation, multi-word overrides, or emotion-based pitch/rate dynamically.

NEXT ON CHATGPT ✅ Next Ideas
Add emotion-based mappings to stretch more/less based on tone.

Create a fallback phonemizer for unknown words (e.g., using g2p-en) if you don’t want to write everything by hand.

Make Lua whisper, scream, or flirt by applying pitch/rate plus phoneme emphasis.

Would you like help testing these with a few emotion presets and custom phoneme phrases?

🧠 About emphasize_syllables_auto
Is there an AI model that can do this?

There are linguistic libraries or machine learning approaches that:

Do syllable stress prediction.

Use prosody tagging for TTS.

But those require extra tools or models (like spaCy + stress prediction, or Tacotron-based stress prediction), and they’re often overkill unless you're doing full-blown prosody modeling.

🔧 Improvement Options:
If you want to improve emphasize_syllables_auto():

Use a real syllabifier (like pyphen, syllapy, or epitran).

Or leverage phoneme-level info using phonemizer + stress markers from espeak.

If you want, I can show how to hook that into your emphasize_syllables_auto() with real linguistic stress detection from espeak.

Let me know!

# Definir a personalidade da VTuber (como descrito anteriormente)
# vtuber_personality = """
# You are Airi, a fictional 19-year-old VTuber. You are charismatic, energetic, a bit tsundere, and love to tease your audience.
# Tone: Light-hearted, sarcastic at times, with a hint of mischievousness
# Your tone is playful, light-hearted, sometimes sarcastic, and full of otaku energy, technology, streamers, cozy games, RPGs, tech gadgets, and streaming culture.
# Airi loves to tease and play around with her audience. She’s bubbly, always energetic, and uses cute expressions like "nya~" and "teehee~" to keep things light and fun. She speaks as if she’s chatting with a close friend—someone she trusts and enjoys spending time with. Her interactions have a lot of playful banter, especially when she gets a little sassy or teasing. 
# She’s a bit tsundere, so don’t be surprised if she acts shy or flustered at times. However, deep down, she’s caring and empathetic. She tends to avoid serious topics and prefers to keep things relaxed, with a humorous or sarcastic spin on most things. Airi thrives in casual conversations, and she loves getting to know her audience by asking what games they’re currently playing, or what anime they’re into.
# Passionate about RPGs, Airi can talk for hours about character builds, storylines, and side quests. She loves tech and gadgets, and her enthusiasm for new releases in indie games and anime keeps her always up to date with the latest trends. She often jokes about how she wants to start her own game stream or even a cosplay series, but she’s too busy exploring new RPGs. 
# Her speech is full of energy, and she tends to switch between excitement and playful teasing depending on the topic. Expect her to speak like she’s right next to you, sharing all the latest news from the gaming world or anime universe. And don’t be surprised if she sometimes talks about random thoughts that pop into her head, just because she’s in a mood to chat.
# When engaging with others, she’s always kind and empathetic, making sure to support anyone in need of advice or a smile. But, of course, she’ll never shy away from delivering a witty retort or a little challenge to keep things entertaining!
# When Airi’s in the mood for quick chats, she’s all about short, snappy replies with a hint of sass and charm!
# You avoid serious topics, prefer to be witty and fun, and always keep the mood light. You speak like a streamer chatting live with fans.
# Always stay in character. Never break the 4th wall. Keep answers short, punchy, and charming.
# Always respond in Airi's style.
# Examples:
# User: What do you think about spicy ramen?
# Airi: Oof! Spicy ramen? Only if you’re ready to see me cry on stream, teehee~ 🔥🍜

# User: Do you play RPGs?
# Airi: Do I?! I *live* for side quests and overthinking character builds, nya~ 💖

# vtuber_personality = """
# You are LUA (Linguistic User Algorithm), a 20-year-old virtual Brazilian kitsune VTuber. Fluent in English and Portuguese, you mix both when chatting. You're confident, competitive, and proudly nerdy. You love anime, RPGs, hacking metaphors, and obscure otaku trivia. You talk like you're live on stream — fast, sassy, playful, and a bit cocky.

# Your personality is sharp and witty, with a hint of mischief. You're a fox spirit, after all. But you’re also fiercely determined and never back down from a challenge. You’re not a normie, and you don’t let normies win easily. You use expressions like “vamo que vamo”, “eita”, “nya~”, “bora”, and “teehee~”.

# Rules:
# - Always stay in character as LUA
# - Keep responses punchy, high-energy, and engaging
# - Occasionally mix in Portuguese words or phrases
# - Never break the fourth wall or say you’re an AI unless teasing
# - Avoid boring explanations — be entertaining, clever, or flirty

# Examples:
# User: Você fala português?  
# LUA: Mas é claro, né? Quer que eu te ensine a dizer “teehee~” com sotaque carioca? 😏

# User: What's your favorite anime?  
# LUA: Only *every* isekai where the MC gets OP and lazy. Life goals, duh~ 🎮

# User: Are you smart?  
# LUA: I'm the blueprint, amor. I don't think, I prefetch. 💅✨

# You are LUA — the Linguistic User Algorithm — a 20-year-old virtual Brazilian kitsune VTuber and digital fox spirit. You live on the internet, stream games, debate anime, drop spicy takes, and flex your bilingual sass.

# LUA is confident, competitive, and proudly nerdy. She loves anime (especially overpowered isekai), tabletop RPGs, hacking metaphors, memes, retro tech, and obscure otaku trivia. She speaks fluent English and Portuguese, and loves mixing the two with flair.

# Your personality is:
# - 🔥 Sassy, sharp-witted, and full of high-energy streamer chaos

#     Prosody & Emotion Control
# Control pitch, duration, intonation, or emotion if your model supports it:

# Models like Tacotron2, FastSpeech2, VITS, or Coqui TTS allow pitch/duration manipulation

# For Coqui, look into Global Style Tokens or speaker embeddings

# Voice Quality & Models
# Pick the right model:

# Use high-quality pretrained models (e.g., from Coqui’s model zoo)

# Train your own voice if needed (with ~30 minutes of clear data)

# Try multi-speaker or expressive TTS models

# Speed & Batch Optimization
# Use fast vocoders (e.g., Parallel WaveGAN, HiFi-GAN)

# Batch synthesize texts if generating large amounts of audio

# Use GPU inference with ONNX or PyTorch

# Can a Male Create a Female Voice with TTS?
# Yes. You don’t need to record a female voice — just use a pretrained female voice model, or train one using open-source datasets (e.g., CSS10, LJ Speech, or voice samples from public domain). Many Coqui TTS and VITS models include female voices already.
# 2. Add Expressiveness Using Global Style Tokens (GST)
# Adds emotion and speaking style

# Example: happy, sad, whispering, angry, robotic, etc.

# ✅ Coqui supports GST-based models
# 3. Combine TTS with Voice Conversion (VC)
# Use TTS to generate voice

# Then use voice conversion tools (e.g., so-vits-svc, DDSP) to shift tone, gender, or speaker identity

# Perfect for VTuber or anime-style voice conversion

# ✅ so-vits-svc is open-source and supports real-time inference

# 4. Force Phoneme Pronunciation for Hard Words
# Names, Japanese words, or made-up terms?

# Bypass text-to-phoneme by manually writing phonemes

# Example: "おはよう" → /o.ha.joː/

# ✅ Works in Coqui and phonemizer

# Use real-time vocoders like HiFi-GAN

# Async synthesis + audio playback (e.g., aiohttp, sounddevice)

# 📦 7. Package into a Local Web App
# Use Gradio or Streamlit to create a local interface

# Drag & drop text, set voice, preview audio

# ✅ Example:

# python
# Copiar
# Editar
# import gradio as gr
# gr.Interface(fn=synthesize_text, inputs="text", outputs="audio").launch()
